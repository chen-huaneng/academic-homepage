  <p>
    I am a first-year Master of Science (M.S.) student in Management Science at Xiamen University, currently conducting research under the supervision of <a href="https://smr.xmu.edu.cn/TeacherWeb/Teacher_Details_2022.aspx?User_ID=895" target="_blank">Shan Jiang</a>. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Management Science, also from Xiamen University.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests span operations research and machine learning, with a current focus on the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem with multiple drops (FSTSP-MD, a variant of the classic TSP).
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of my academic work, I am a passionate self-learner with a deep interest in diverse areas of computer science and mathematics. I maintain a GitHub repository called <a href="https://github.com/chen-huaneng/Notes" target="_blank">Notes</a> and a blog <a href="https://chen-huaneng.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> to share my self-learning notes and experiences.
